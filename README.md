### Project Title
Bike-share Project

### Description
This project was carried out in the context of a data science course on Udacity.

3 bikeshare related datasets are provided (from chicago, new york and washington).

The script lets the user decide which dataset he wishes to analyse. It then asks the user to filter the data out by month and/or by day if he desires.

After calculation, it displays a list of statistics and gives the user the choice to display the actual dataset or to quit the program.

Inputs:
city - name of the city to analyze
month - name of the month to filter by, or "all" to apply no month filter
day - name of the day of week to filter by, or "all" to apply no day filter
